	Based of 7-1 principle for SASS architecture

	BEM scheme
	
	Should be formatted as such:
	{{ block }}--{{ element }}__{{ modifier }}
	
	Block, Element, and Modifier names should be kebab case
	1. Block: Encapsulates a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own.
	2. Element: Semantically tied to a block and has no standalone meaning.
	3. Modifiers: Flags on blocks or elements. Use them to change appearance, behavior or state.
